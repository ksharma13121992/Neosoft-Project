== Installation ==

1. Create a Database, Add a user to the database with full privilege. Note down the database name, Database user and password locally. We will need it in the next step. If your new server is typical cPanel hosting.

2.Upload both installer and Archive file (.zip format): Access your new hosting server via FTP and upload the installer and archive file at the root location of your domain on the new server.

3. Once you are done with this, you need to open your new server I.P. with installer.php at the end. What I did here is, I edited my local computer hosts file to map the domain name to new I.P, this made working easier.

4. You need to add your new database details and click on Test connection to see if everything is working fine or not. In a majority of the cases, your host would be localhost and rest database detail will be from the database you just created on the new server.

5. Click on next, and you will see a screen of old settings. Here you need to fill up all site details like url, path etc. 

6. Click on next, and if you are done everything right way, your existing WordPress site is migrated to a new server.
